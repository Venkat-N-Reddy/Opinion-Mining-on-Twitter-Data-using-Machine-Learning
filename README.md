## [Opinion Mining On Twitter Data Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/venkat-narahari/Opinion-Mining-on-Twitter-Data-using-Machine-learning)

Social Network Services is a domain of its own that has created a digital platform where people can post their diverse opinions on people, products, politics, services, enterprises, entertainment and others, thus influencing the trends in these wide fields. The large amount of data available on these social services can give deep insights which can help device various strategies for organizations, politics and government.
Opinion Mining is one such way where text can be analysed to get knowledge on polarity or sentiment of a product or a service on scale by linguistic computations with natural language processing and text mining. This is further automated by the use of machine learning which uses preprocessing for maintaining consistency and supervised learning algorithm which uses support vector machines. As the machine gets exercised with more data the results get less imperfect and more accurate.
In this project we use Twitter API to gather data and generate sentiment visualizations using Support Vector Machines.
